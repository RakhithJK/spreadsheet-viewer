# Spreadsheet Viewer release package

This package contains:

1. browsable Quick Start examples for Angular, React, Vue, and plain JavaScript (see below for instructions)
2. a product brochure in file `Spreadsheet Viewer.pdf`
3. an uncustomized build of Spreadsheet Viewer in the directory `spreadsheet-viewer`

## Quick Start

To run the Quick Start examples of Spreadsheet Viewer, start a local HTTP static file server in the package root directory.

A few ways to do that, depending on your OS:

- using Node on any OS: `npx http-server -p 8080`
- using Python 3 on Windows or Linux: `python -m http.server 8080`
- using Python 3 on macOS: `python3 -m http.server 8080`

Then, go to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
