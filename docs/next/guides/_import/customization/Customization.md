Some aspects of Spreadsheet Viewer's appearance can be tweaked by [[UI configuration|JavaScript API UI configuration]] in our APIs. 

However, to heavily customize the appearance or to add your own features to Spreadsheet Viewer, you will need to make a [[Custom build]]. 

The project follows a layered [[Architecture|Project architecture]]. The source code needed to make custom builds is available in the code repository listed in [[Prerequisites]].

Note that changes made in custom builds are not supported by the regular support packages.
